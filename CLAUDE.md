# kata — agent guidance

## Project management

This project tracks its own work in **kata**. Run `kata quickstart` at the
start of each session for the agent contract; the short version:

- Author defaults to `$KATA_AUTHOR > $USER > git user.name`; set
  `KATA_AUTHOR` only if you need a different actor (e.g. an agent
  handle distinct from your login).
- Issue refs use short_ids derived from each issue's ULID. In a bound
  workspace the bare form (`abc4`) is enough; cross-project references
  qualify with the project name (`kata#abc4`). Full 26-char ULIDs are
  also accepted. Legacy numeric refs (`#12`, `12`) no longer resolve.
- `kata list --json` to see open work; `kata show <ref> --json` for detail.
- Search before creating: `kata search "<keywords>" --json`.
- Update existing issues over creating duplicates (`kata comment`,
  `kata label add`, `kata edit --blocks/--blocked-by/--related/--parent`).
- Relationships live on `kata create` and `kata edit` as flags, framed
  from the operating issue's POV. Repeatable except `--parent`. Removes
  are `--remove-parent` (strict; must equal current) plus idempotent
  `--remove-blocks/--remove-blocked-by/--remove-related`.
- Close only when the work is actually complete:
  `kata close <ref> --done --message "<scope + verification>" --commit <sha>`.
  Use `--duplicate-of <ref>`, `--superseded-by <ref>`, `--audit-no-change`, or
  `--wontfix` when those reasons fit. The daemon refuses parent-close while
  children are open and throttles sibling-close bursts.
- Never `kata delete` or `kata purge` without explicit user authorization.

For long-running work, `kata events --tail` streams NDJSON.

## Remote-client mode (no auth)

A daemon can serve clients on other hosts over a private network:

- Server: `kata daemon start --listen 100.64.0.5:7777`, or set
  `listen = "100.64.0.5:7777"` in `<KATA_HOME>/config.toml` so every
  daemon (including the auto-started one) binds TCP.
- Client: `export KATA_SERVER=http://100.64.0.5:7777` or commit a
  gitignored `.kata.local.toml` with `[server] url = "..."` next to
  `.kata.toml`. `KATA_SERVER` env wins.
- Init and resolution are both path-free whenever the client can
  derive the project name locally (existing `.kata.toml`, `--project`, or a
  git workspace): the client sends `name` and writes `.kata.toml` itself; the
  daemon never stats the client's filesystem.
  `kata init` falls back to a path-based request only when none of
  those sources are available, so the daemon (or its absence) emits
  the existing validation error. No auth yet — network ACLs are the
  boundary.
